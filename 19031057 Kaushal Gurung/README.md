This is the  website create using html5, css3 and javascript.
# Coursework of Information System
While doing this course work, I used Brackets as my text editor. Brackets makes a big deal of the fact that it’s written using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While this may mean little for the casual user, those who wish to extend – or even hack it – have the opportunity to do so using technologies they’re probably already familiar with. The fact that it’s open-sourced also makes it stand out from the crowd. Sublime, for example, is a commercial product, while Atom is closed-source and won’t be free forever. And the fact is I don’t like the code editor like Visual Studio code and Sublime text because of its black background as well as it stressed out my eyes very often.
For making the wireframe I used ‘Balsamiq Mockups 3’ as it was recommended by our teacher and I was a bit lazy to search for other application which would also create wireframe.
My webpage is responsive and has responsive navigation bar with “logo which leads to idex.html, home-home.html, Cv-cv.html, Blog-blog.html, Research-research.html, Contact-contact.html Time which shows real-time and social site icons which are linked to respective sites.” Has slider and various linked buttons which are linked with other pages of the website.
The home page has slider which on click slides through contents. It also consists content which has buttons which can link the user to other pages without scrolling to the top of the page. It also has some context of the blog and button which on click opens up the blog page. It also has footer with details and linked social buttons.
The next page is the CV page which contains a downloadable Pdf file which includes My Cv which is uploaded in the page with the embed tag. The blog page contains blog on the topic “Effects of technology in students”. The research page contains all the research that I had done while making this website. And finally the contact page contains fillable form which uses JavaScript to detect errors and also gives alert message with the form was filled successfully.
