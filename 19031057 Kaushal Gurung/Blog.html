                     <h1>Effect of technology in students </h1>
                      <h4>By Kaushal Gurung | 10th January,2020</h4>
                     <p>Over the last 2 to 3 decades technology has become our day to day part in our lives. We are all surrounded by technology and are so being used to with technology. Most of our works are done through technology and we are completely depended upon them. At this point technology has taken over our lives. Looking around us we are surrounded by them. Our computers, smartphones, television and other gadgets that we use daily, they are all around us. Technology has changed the way be work, communicate and interact with each other. In addition, the booming expansion of e-commerce and internet-based companies is directly proportional to the rapid proliferation of smartphones.<br>
	Like all things technology also has its positive and negative aspect. Technology does not determine it. It is demanded upon the user on how to use it, do you use it in a positive way or negative way. Technology, if not used proper can be very harmful to the society and the environment. While the smartphone has made our work easy and revolutionary but it has made us lazy. Today you can do many things without going anywhere, everything is at the tip of your fingers and can be done by you sitting at home. Thus, we don’t have to go to palaces to work lie we did previously to get things done. We are so depended on technology that we are eventually harming ourselves with lack of activated in our body and not doing any physical activity. This especially true for the younger generation, we are so depended upon technology and spend hours and hours using them. They are so glued to their smartphone and don’t do any type of physical activity. In this modern age, smartphone addiction has been increasing day by day and has been harming our lives.<br>
Not only the negative impacts but there are many positive impacts to our lives has well. We can also technology changing our lives every day. With the use of technology and the help of it we have been able to accomplish so any achievement in different fields. Technology has helped us in improving communication, the use of different technologies we are able to communicate with people that are way from their home and also communicate from one place to another place. The use of smartphone can help us reach to anyone in a matter of minutes or seconds which is really helpful to each and everyone of us. Likewise, the use of technology in transportation, it has also helped us a lot in this field and some many developments can be seen regarding it. With the help of technology, we can reach different palace as fast as possible. Different technological innovations like airplanes, trains, metros have helped us reach palace in a faster way day by day. It has changed the way of traveling and made it so munch easier. If we use technology properly, we can also help the environment a lot and the bunch of societies and people living there. Technology in education has made a revolutionary change in the field of learning. Teaching and learning have been made so simpler and easy to learn and interesting.<br>
Technology can improve student’s engagement. Education technology cane make learning more interactive and collaborate- and this can help students better engage with course material. Rather than memorizing facts, they learn by doing. This could be as simple as taking an interactive quiz in class or participating in tech-enabled group discussions or as involved as playing educational games, practicing science experiments in a virtual lab or taking a virtual field trip.
But to make it truly engaging, it must be truly interactive. Doing math on a computer isn’t any different than doing math with a pencil and pad of paper. But using augmented reality to animate math challenges is a whole different ballgame. For some students, interactivity provides a better learning experience. <br>
Technology can also expand classroom boundaries, with the technology the class room has no boundaries. Any one can learn from any part of the world and get equal amount of knowledge. <br>
In a traditional classroom, students who were struggling to learn new concepts would quickly fall behind their peers. With online assignments, however, students can advance at their own pace. Those who need more time or extra help can practice outside of class with guided exercises or additional coursework. Thanks to the always-on nature of technology, students can access resources online whenever they need to, and instructors can see which students might need extra help. The exercise of self-paced learning also helps students learn digital literacy and 21st century skills, which will be useful when they enter the workforce.<br>
Like all thinks there are both positive and negative aspects to this, it just depends upon the person that is using it and what s/he is using it for. If used proper it can harm us but if used proper it can help in many ways. While technology is sometimes seen as a threat—and it does have its limits—integrating it into your teaching practice offers a new way for students to interact and engage with course material. Thanks to technology, education is no longer confined to the walls of your classroom. YouTube videos and social media don’t have to be a distraction; they can be part of your course material. The math is easy: it adds up to better learning outcomes.
